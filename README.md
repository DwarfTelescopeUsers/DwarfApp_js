# Dwarf II Demo

Website that connects to the Dwarf II telescope via the Dwarf II API. The Dwarf II API and this website are very much in beta phase, so this website has limited functionality.

This app is built with Next.js, Typescript, and Bootstrap css. This app uses eslint and Prettier to lint and format the code.

## Setup for coders

If you are interested in seeing how the code works or contributing to the project, then follow these steps.

1. Clone this repo.

2. Install libraries.

```
npm install
```

3. Start server.

```
npm run dev
```

## Setup for non-coders

Work in progress.

<!--

If you just want to get the site up and running on your machine, then follow these steps.

1. Download the zipped files for the website.

2. Unzip the files. A DwarfApp directory will be add.

3. Start a server inside the DwarfApp directory. I recommend using Python's webserver

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in a browser. -->
